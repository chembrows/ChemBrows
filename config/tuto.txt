The very cool feature now: Chembrows includes machine learning ! 
--
<p>
Chembrows learns from your input and classifies the articles by "Hot Paperness":
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-top: 20px">opening <b>AND</b> liking articles <b>INCREASES</b> the "Hot Paperness" of similar reasearch works</li>
<li style="margin-top: 20px">opening <b>WITHOUT</b> liking articles <b>DECREASES</b> the "Hot Paperness" of similar research works</li>
</ul>
</p>
